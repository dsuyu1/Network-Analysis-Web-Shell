# Lab: Network Analysis Web Shell
##### Skills: Wireshark, TCPDump, TShark
## Scenario
The SOC received an alert in their SIEM for "Local to Local Port Scanning" where an internal private IP began scanning another internal system. Can you investigate and determine if this activity is malicious or not? You have been given a PCAP to investigate using any tools you'd like. 

## Introduction
In this lab, I investigated PCAPs from the perspective of a SOC analyst. I conducted the lab using a Kali Linux virtual machine.
